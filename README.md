# Flash-card-game
Welcome to my math flash card game application! 
This frontend application is not only a fun way to practice your math skills but also an opportunity for me to explore Tailwind CSS.

In this game, your goal is to solve math equations and score points.
There are four levels of increasing difficulty, with one additional operator added in each level.
